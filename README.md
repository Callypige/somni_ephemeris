# Welcome to the Somnis Ephemeris, a dream diary
### This project is created with Reactjs & Firestore & MaterialUI
Some major update will appear like authentification with email/password, 
show details of dreams, delete dream on by one, more style css, etc...
THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISH, SO FAR AWAY

### What can we do for now ?
We can display all dreams with firestore without any authentification and add new dreams with form.


Just start project with npm start

(The project will be available with Netlify)
